This is a generated RPPA Report generated from the following scripts, 

-Pathway_Score_calculator.ipynb
- Score_Caluclator.Rmd (eventually this will be encorporated into the Pathway_Score_calculator.ipynb)
-Pathway_Score_calculator.ipynb
-Pathway_prepare_Density_maper.Rmd
-Heat_mapper.Rmd
-RPPA_Report.Rmd


All Scripts must be run prior to running this script or it will not work,Knit this file together and a HTML report will be generated if you wish to change the format of this file you may alter HTML instructions.

# This is the report file for Patient ______ 

packages and data read in 
```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(reactable)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#You will need to change the files to the correct ones that you generated from the previous scripts

```

**First Lets take a look at the pathway Scores**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
reactable(Pathway_Scores)
```
Lets look at the pathway scoring 
```{r}

kbl(Pathway_key, booktabs = T)


```


**Now lets look at the the proteins that were dropped from the Pathways analysis**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
reactable(Not_Included)
```

**The following samples are missing**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#lets remove the samples that are all present
Missing_Samples<-Missing_Samples%>%
  filter(V2!=0)%>%
  rename("Sample"="V1",
         "Amount_Missing"="V2")
#now show it 
reactable(Missing_Samples)
```
#Our Sample Patient ______ is missing 
```{r}
#This part will need to be altered depending on our patient of intrest
Missing_Sample_for_Our_patient<-Missing_Samples%>%filter(Sample=="261035")
reactable(Missing_Sample_for_Our_patient)
```

Sepcifically it is missing the following proteins
```{r}
Missing_Proteins_Full<-Missing_Proteins_Full%>%select(Predictor,"261035")#THIS NEEDS TO BE ALTERED TO DISIRED SAMPLE OR SAMPLES

proteins<-Missing_Proteins_Full[is.na(Missing_Proteins_Full$`261035`),]

reactable(proteins)
```



**The Following Proteins are missing**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#lets remove the samples that are all present 
Missing_Proteins<-Missing_Proteins%>%
  filter(V2!=0)%>%
  rename("Protein"="V1",
         "Amount_Missing"="V2")
#lets visualize it
reactable(Missing_Proteins)
```

**We can also visualize the missing proteins in histograms to make it more understandable**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
col<-ggplot(Missing_Proteins, aes(Protein,Amount_Missing,fill=Protein))+geom_col()+theme_classic()+ ggtitle("Missing Proteins By Amount Missing")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+ theme(legend.position="none")

col
```
#There was ____ Samples with a largen than normal missing amount of proteins these were removed and the graph was remade for visability purposes 
```{r}
#This section is going to have to be used on a case by case basis bedpending on how many missing samples are present 
Missing_Proteins2<-Missing_Proteins%>%filter(Protein != "CASPASE3CLEAVED")
col2<-ggplot(Missing_Proteins2, aes(Protein,Amount_Missing,fill=Protein))+geom_col()+theme_classic()+ ggtitle("Missing Proteins By Amount Missing")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+ theme(legend.position="none")
